SQL project: the task was to create data of famous artists and describe what they do. Query the data created with SQL statements.

First Step : compiled the data from a google search

i initially created a table containing famous bands to ever exist. The first table listed their names and their country of origin.
The next table contained the year the band was initiated and the genre, the last table contained a hit song but the specific band.

Second Step: Joined the tables
I joined the 3 tables in one query on the id columns

Third Step: I queried the table
